# The Exchange structure represents any exchange initialized in the contract. It takes as parameters:
# -  the seller of the goods
# -  the buyer of the goods whose tokens are going to be held in the contract
# -  the type of the exchange (by default in the demo it can only be a DOMAIN_NAME)
# -  the timestamp of last update of the state of the exchange
# -  a structure representing the total_escrow with the following fields: 
#    -  the amount sent to be stored in the contract
#    -  the calculated slashing amount: the incentive for the buyer to validate the exchange at the end of the escrow; If he validates the exchange he gets the slashing amount back, if not, he looses it.
#    -  the calculated commission amount: the commission on the escrow type that is sent to the contract owne at the end of the exchange 
#    -  the price of the goods set by the seller
# - the hash of the domain name
